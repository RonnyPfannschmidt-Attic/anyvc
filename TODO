* py.test based integration testing on multiple vcs versions via

  * virtualenv
  * vsp 

* a way to select the vcs to choose for init of repo/workdir
* history view
* fs branches <> clones

  * shared data support ( bzr ? )

* semantic branches <> bookmarks/git branches
* checkouts of semantic branches in repos
* pull/push granularity repo vs set of branches vs branch
* merge granularity

  * fs branches
  * semantic branches


* how the heck will svn fit

  * fs branches 

* deal with different orders of disconnections/existences 
  of the different repo/brach/workdir models
